### dig straight down
You cannot remove a stone block you are standing on in survival mode.

### head banger
To overused to block, but at least it is better than digging straight down.

### floaters
To much work to cover all tree types, try dedicated plugins.

### filthy redstone
Block enderman from altering blocks if something redstony is in a one block radius.
Dirt is not blocked, since sometimes building materials are scarse.

### a fine line
Detect if the player in in nether and is walking on a 1 block narrow path.
Recipe for disaster, yet not forbidden, so slowness I for safety sake.
